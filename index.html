These passion projects, ranging from market women’s politics to literary whiteness in Shakespeare, demonstrate the diverse achievements of Barnard’s underrepresented academics. A cheerful cherry blossom emoji highlights upcoming events, such as in-person Cite-a-Thon events and an exhibit that immerses viewers in faculty work, while a bold, blue diamond emoji guides visitors to a Google Form that encourages them to submit their own citations of creative works by Black Barnard faculty members in order to expand the website’s database. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The act of citation—to quote or refer to the work done by an academic—is necessary, as it celebrates the published work of deserving scholars. CBBF, a multimedia project that has grown to include both a website and on-campus events which aim to spotlight Black scholarship, was the brainchild of Alexandra Watson, a First-Year Writing lecturer at Barnard and the associate director of the college’s writing program. Watson had started thinking about how to highlight the work and contributions of Black Barnard faculty well before beginning the project. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “We don’t have a lot of opportunities as a community to be engaged around the work of our faculty members,” she said. </p> <div class="graphic"> <!DOCTYPE html> <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"> <head><style>figure{position:relative;width:70vw;height:70vh;margin:30px auto}iframe{top:0;overflow:auto;display:block;height:90%}figcaption,iframe{position:absolute;width:100%}figcaption{bottom:0;height:5%;font:12px/20px Roboto,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;text-align:center}img{top:0;overflow:auto;display:block;height:100%;width:auto;border:0;padding:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:10px}</style></head> <html lang="en"><body> <figure> <iframe title="Litmaps Embedded Map &quot;Things of Darkness: ...&quot;" src="https://app.litmaps.co/embed/CA2CF2B9-8C3D-46AC-A448-3A300782B74D?graphConfig=%7B%22scaleMode%22%3A%22citations%22%2C%22xAxisMode%22%3A%22compact%22%2C%22yAxisMode%22%3A%22compact%22%2C%22edgeMode%22%3A%22alwaysOn%22%2C%22labelContentMode%22%3A%22author%22%2C%22graphError%22%3Anull%7D"> </iframe> <figcaption> A map of works that have cited Kim Hall's <em>Things of Darkness: Economies of Race and Gender in Early Modern England,</em> itself one of the works cited by Cite Black Barnard Faculty.

The reading group, which focused on deepening the study of anti-racism, led Watson to take action by creating her own project to uplift the achievements of her colleagues, such as Professor Kim Hall’s work on literary whiteness in Shakespeare and Professor Yvette Christiansë’s collection of poetry, <i>Castaway</i>, which focuses on her South African heritage. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The Cite Black Barnard Faculty project began as a one-time Cite-a-Thon, <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2021/02/19/cite-black-barnard-faculty-cite-a-thon-calls-for-representation-in-the-classroom/">a virtual event</a> held in February 2021 that invited college staff and students to read, annotate, and cite the work of Black Barnard professors. The planning of the event, however, came with its own hurdles. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “We were trying to design a program that didn’t exist,” said Siena Mills, a Barnard junior who worked on the project. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Mills remembers the team’s worries, which included both the issue of generating engagement on Zoom and finding support from Barnard’s administration. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “It’s so difficult to plan an event,” Mills said. “It opened my eyes to how gatekept all of these links and contacts and resources are.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> After months of preparation, the project’s first Cite-a-Thon was an overall success. “There was so much joy and possibility emanating from our screens during the event,” wrote Jennifer Rosales, the executive director of Barnard’s Center for Engaged Pedagogy, in a statement on the project. Rosales, who attended the Cite-a-Thon, went on to explain how the event allowed her to learn about the insightful work of her Black colleagues. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “It was a really nice, very communal feeling, even on Zoom,” agreed Martha Tenney, another event attendee and the director of Barnard’s Archives and Special Collections. </p> <div class="graphic"> <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"><head></head><body> <figure> <img src="wordcloud_freq25.118cffd8.png"> <figcaption> <br>By Dreyton Amador / Graphics reporter </figcaption> </figure> </body></html> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Using the citations generated by the Cite-a-Thon’s attendees, Watson and her team created a database of citations and turned this database into what is currently the CBBF website. Regarding her reasoning behind creating an easily accessible database of citations, Watson explained her desire to make the project as collaborative as possible. “It was important to me that other people began being involved in the process really early on,” Watson said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> When asked about the project’s impact, Watson took a slight pause to consider what Cite Black Barnard Faculty has achieved. “It may be too early to answer that in a way that feels satisfying to me.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> However, Watson has noticed that the project has generated support within the Barnard community, specifically among students. When she posted a new student assistant position on Barnard Works, the college’s website for part-time student employment opportunities, applications from enthusiastic students quickly streamed in. The responses from student applicants were overwhelmingly positive, with students speaking about the underrepresentation of Black faculty within Barnard as well as how they needed to make a deliberate effort to find Black faculty members to work with. “Their responses to why [they wanted to work on this project] made me understand that this project is necessary,” explained Watson. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Mills, who has served as a student assistant to the project since the early days of its inception, echoed the project’s significance, specifically among students. “I want to be taught by people whom I’ve never been taught by before,” stated Mills. “Being a Black woman having Black professors–-it changed my learning experience.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The project continues to shift the academic canon, generating conversations about diversity among texts taught in Barnard classrooms. Tenney, who has long worked on archival projects recording the history of the college, emphasized the significance of regularly examining Barnard’s relationship with diversity. For example, Tenney cited how Quandra Prettyman, the college’s first Black faculty member to receive full-time employment, received her position at the college only around fifty years ago, in 1970. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “From an archivist’s perspective … it’s not a long history [of] Barnard, the institution, employing Black scholars,” explained Tenney. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Mills emphasized the need to normalize a culture where people who aren’t necessarily at the forefront of academia are celebrated. “Barnard is the perfect place to have a culture like that,” said Mills. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In the future, Watson hopes to expand the project to include Black scholars at other schools, such as Columbia College. “One of the definite goals,” said Watson, “is having an influence for others to create something similar.” Another big goal for the project is to include more multimedia elements in the project to generate more engagement and create an immersive experience for event participants. Upcoming CBBF events include a multimedia exhibit to be held in early March at Barnard’s Movement Lab, a faculty salon where Black faculty members can share their current work, and multiple Cite-a-Thon events open to faculty members and students from both Barnard and Columbia campuses. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> CBBF, a project that has evolved and achieved so much over the course of a year, will continue to spark necessary conversations about what it means to be a Black scholar in academia. “The project continues to grow and push the boundaries of what counts as a citation … and how we uplift and build on the scholarly and artistic contributions of our Black colleagues at Barnard,” wrote Rosales on CBBF’s lasting impact on the community. Watson hopes that her project leaves people questioning their own part in upholding diversity, be it in the academic canon or in their own lives. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Center Black women in everything you do,” urged Watson. “Academically, administratively—and know that centering them does not always mean burdening them.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Eye Staff Writer </i><i>Melissa Wang</i><i> can be contacted at </i><i>melissa.wang@columbiaspectator.com.</i><i> Follow The Eye on </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/theeye.mag/"><i>Instagram</i></a><i>.</i> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Jun Yi Zhang is a Graphics reporter.
