These passion projects, ranging from market women’s politics to literary whiteness in Shakespeare, demonstrate the diverse achievements of Barnard’s underrepresented academics. A cheerful cherry blossom emoji highlights upcoming events, such as in-person Cite-a-Thon events and an exhibit that immerses viewers in faculty work, while a bold, blue diamond emoji guides visitors to a Google Form that encourages them to submit their own citations of creative works by Black Barnard faculty members in order to expand the website’s database."

Upcoming CBBF events include a multimedia exhibit to be held in early March at Barnard’s Movement Lab, a faculty salon where Black faculty members can share their current work, and multiple Cite-a-Thon events open to faculty members and students from both Barnard and Columbia campuses."
